# tax-calc
CLI Tax Calculator

This is a Command Line Tax Calculator.

Given a config file (included in the resources folder), one can estimate the taxes owed based on if the income and if
the individual is single, married or head-of-household.

The config file values can be adjusted to alter the calculations.

We display the breakdown by tax bracket (bracket 0 is the standard deduction) and also
list the total tax owed and the effective tax rate.
